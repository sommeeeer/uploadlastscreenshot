# uploadlastscreenshot

A way to upload your latest screenshot taken with printscreen. This little script is looking for the newest screenshot and then uploading it to a SFTP server. Then giving you the link and putting it into clipboard. Mainly made this script to be faster to send someone on IRC or other networks where you want to share screenshots of your screen, but cant paste the actual image.
